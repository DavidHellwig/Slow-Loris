Guide:

"Target Address" - This is the address of the target that will be attacked once the "Start Attack" button is pressed.
    If the target does not use "https", the attack will not work

"Socket Count" - Input the amount of sockets you want to use in the attack

"Start Attack" - This button starts the slow loris attack on the designated target.

In order to run the program, run the NewUI class. 
While the tool may appear to not be responding while it's running, it is in fact running. To stop the attack you may close the program.
